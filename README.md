### Hi, my name is Cláudio Mindouro 👋

Nowadays I’m working as a Front-End Developer at [wild](https://wild.as/) in Vienna, Austria.

Previously I worked at [Pixelmatters](https://www.pixelmatters.com/) as a Full-Stack Developer.

I’m passionate about technology and design and have been able to work in both areas with clients such as `Honda`, `Rubrik`, `EDP`, `Porto.`, the `Portuguese Republic` and much more.
